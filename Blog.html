	<p>"Humans Need Not Apply" by Youtuber CGP Grey tells us humans how robots will be taking over our jobs and how they are already starting. CPG shows us example of how computers and technology are taking jobs. For example, horses used to be used for work in transportation and now we use cars instead. In the next few years we will become the horses, in which our jobs will be taken.</p>
	<p>While watching this video, you might get scared from not being able to work. You might think that robots and computers are being in power. You might think this will lead to the end of the world. However, computers taking over might not be all negatives. PLus no matter what there will always be a human job. There is things that humans can do that robots cant do. Humans program computers. Its also real easy for us to stop them. I just think humans shouldnt worry. </p>

	<h2>THE SECOND BLOG</h2>
	<img src="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/themes/blown-to-bits/images/white-ban.gif">

	<p>Blown To Bits by Hal Abelson, Harry Lewis, and Ken Ledeen talks about fasanating facts about technolgy and a lot of things that we dont know about computers. </p>

	<h3>Footprints and Fingerprints</h3>

	<p>Apparently being on the internet is like walking on muddy grounds. They both leave prints. Everytime you go online and use your computer, that website saves your IP address and information that you was there.</p>

	<h3>Smile When You Snap</h3>
	<p>There are webcams everywhere and anyone can be recorded. If you commit a crime, someone can easily take photo or video evidence to prove you did it. Photos can also be traced back to people and find out.</p>

	<h3>Saving Money</h3>

	<p>When you use coupons in stores, loyalty cards can track what you bought.  With loyalty cards, stores can capture details of
cash transactions as well.</p>

<h3>Tsering Dhondup</h3>
<p>The contents of these descriptions is rather bland in my opinion. The explanations are incredibly short and they just provide plain comments on each chapter, no insight at all. I'll specify each chapter description, starting with "Footprints and Fingerprints", this will be the start of the three paragraph long pattern. As for what you actually said, it isn't necessarily wrong, I agree with your statements because they're just plain facts. I don't have much to say about this other than that what you stated is all true and what you stated can only be proven to be true. There is no way to argue against it or try and provide a different perspective on it, there isn't that much to work with.</p>
